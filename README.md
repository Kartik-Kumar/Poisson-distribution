# Poisson-distribution
The likelihood of collisions in hashing tables relates to the well-known mathematical diversion: Probabilities with the Poisson distribution.
Poisson collision predictor – Implement a project that predicts the number of possible collision based on Poisson formula.
Let N = the number of available addresses; r = the number of records to be stored; x = the number of records assigned to a given address; then p(x) gives the probability that a given address will have had x records assigned to it after the hashing function has been applied to all n records.
